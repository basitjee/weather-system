- How long did it take you to finish it? <br>

It took me 10 hours to complete. But I could not put it in one session, because of my busy schedule. I used React, Redux, WebPack, LESS, Babel (ES6, ES7), promises and Prettier for
 making this project. I did not used jQuery. WebPack is added by default in React, so I do not need to put it in package.json, as it comes from node_modules. I do not find any reason
 to use testing framework as it is suitable for large scale application and its just a simple react component. Moreover, testing framework are best suited where numerical calculations
 involved, (for example, we have to reach a certain answer and we can make a test case either our function results the same answer or not) but in our react component case, there was 
 not calculation involved.

- What would you have done if time permitted? <br>

I would allow user to upload skill logo. It would be optional field and show that logo above the name of that technology by resizing all logo to same size, to have cool user 
experience. I would also add skill level ranging from 1-5. I would also create REST API for editing a skill, if time permitted me.
